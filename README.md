## Fine-tuning the model

- Create python virtual environment and install dependencies (requirements.txt)

- SSL certificate issue when trying to download ResNet model from torchvision. To fix this, run the following command:



Check that the endpoint exists/correctly input
try updating cloud credentials json


endpoint seems to have been created but is not beinga accssed correctly
code runs up to line 137 in recog.py 

bounding box creation works
